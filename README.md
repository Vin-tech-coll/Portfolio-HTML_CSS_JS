On the JS code:
The code provided consists of several JavaScript functions that facilitate various functionalities on a webpage:

1. **Navigation Bar Function with Blur Effect:**
   - `myMenuFunction()`: This function toggles a responsive class on the navigation menu (`myNavMenu`). When the menu is opened, it adds a class `responsive` to the menu and adds a `blur` class to the body to create a blur effect. When the menu is closed, it removes these classes.

2. **Typing Effect:**
   - Utilizes the Typed.js library to create a typing effect in an element with the class `.typedText`. It cycles through an array of strings, typing them out, and then backspacing.

3. **Scroll Reveal Animation:**
   - Initializes ScrollReveal.js to animate elements as they become visible during scrolling.
   - Elements with class `.feature-text-card`, `.feature-name`, `.feature-text-info`, `.feature-text-btn`, `.social_icons`, and `.feature-image` are revealed from the top with various delays.
   - `.about-info` and `.contact-info` are revealed from the left with delays.
   - `.skills-box` and `.form-control` are revealed from the right with delays.
   - `.project-box` elements are revealed at intervals of 200ms.
   - `.top-header` elements are also revealed.

4. **Change Active Link on Scroll:**
   - Listens to the scroll event on the window.
   - It iterates through sections with an `id` attribute.
   - When a section is scrolled into view, it adds the class `active-link` to the corresponding link in the navigation menu. When the section is out of view, it removes the class.

Overall, this code creates interactive behaviors on the webpage such as a responsive navigation menu with a blur effect, a typing effect on text, smooth scrolling animations, and active link highlighting based on the current section being viewed.
